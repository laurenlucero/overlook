# Overlook

One week solo project for module 2 of 4 in Front End program at Turing School

## Background & Description

For this project, I built a hotel management tool where hotel guests and management can log in to manage room bookings and spending/revenue.

## Goals & Objectives

- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Work with an API to send and receive data
- Solidify the code review process
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Technologies

- the fetch API to retrieve and add data
- jQuery for DOM manipulation
- Sass for syntactically awesome CSS
- Mocha & Chai
- Webpack

## Install/Setup
1. Clone this repo
2. Run npm install to get dependencies
3. Run npm start to start the webserver
4. Open localhost:8080 in your favorite browser
5. Log in as a User - username: customer[1 - 50] (e.g. customer17) , password: overlook2020 -OR- log in as a Manager - username: manager, password: overlook2020

## MVP & Future Iterations
This application was designed for mobile first and future iterations will include a more desktop friendly format. The current iteration is a fully functional MVP. Issues have been filed for enhancements and bug fixes.
