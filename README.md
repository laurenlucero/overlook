# Overlook
One week solo project for module 2 of 4 in Front End Engineering program at Turing School of Software Development & Design

## Background & Description
For this project, I built a hotel management tool where hotel guests and management can log in to manage room bookings and spending/revenue.

## Install/Setup
1. Clone this repo
2. Run npm install to get dependencies and run npm start to access the webserver
4. Open localhost:8080 in your favorite browser
5. Log in as a User - username: customer[1 - 50] (e.g. customer17) , password: overlook2020 -OR-
log in as a Manager - username: manager, password: overlook2020

## Goals & Objectives
- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Work with an API to send and receive data
- Solidify the code review process
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Technologies
- the fetch API to retrieve and add data
- jQuery for DOM manipulation
- Sass for syntactically awesome CSS
- Mocha & Chai
- Webpack

## MVP & Future Iterations
The current iteration is a functional MVP of a hotel management tool. This application was designed with accessibility in mind and for mobile first. The application passes the lighthouse audits for accessibility (100/100), best practices (93/100) and SEO (90/100). Future iterations will improve desktop/browser compatibility and performance. Issues have been filed for enhancements and bug fixes. Contributors welcome!
